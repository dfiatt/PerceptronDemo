# Perceptron

Welcome to the Perceptron project ‚Äî a simple yet powerful implementation of one of the foundational algorithms in machine learning!

This repository contains the code for a Perceptron classifier built from scratch in Python using NumPy. It is designed to help you understand the basics of linear classification and supervised learning.

---

## Getting Started

All the main code, usage instructions, and examples are inside the `code/` folder.

**Please make sure to open and read the README located in the `code/` directory for detailed setup, usage, and examples.**

---

## Features

- Easy-to-understand implementation
- Adjustable learning rate and epochs
- Prints error counts per training epoch
- Ready for experimentation and customization

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy

---

## Quick Tip

Run your experiments and training scripts inside the `code/` folder to keep things organized.

---

Enjoy learning and experimenting with your Perceptron! üöÄ
